  Under certain situations, a covariate-adjusted response-adaptive (CARA) design often achieves the benefits of both the covariate and response adaptive design. Almost all existing CARA designs use a prognostic score to balance covariates. However, the calculation of the prognostic score requires the use of response as the outcome, which renders complex relationship between the covariate adaptive and response adaptive probabilities. We propose a Bayesian CARA randomization design (termed BCARA) that allows the incorporation of independent covariate and response adaptive probabilities, therefore has a meaningful theoretical justification. The proposed method can be implemented either continuous or at each interim analysis. A variety of scenarios were simulated to evaluate the performance, and the results show that BCARA has desirable operating characteristics,
